# vrseriousgame
A VR Serious Game Escape Room prototype.

Goal of the game is to "order" some things on the dark web using TOR.
The player has to complete a couple puzzles that have to do with the dark web and TOR to be able to go to the next level.

Was created to test if teaching police officers using this method would be received as less boring while still being able to learn from it.

Made in Unity using the Oculus SDK, preferred hardware is a Samsung S6/S7 with a Gear VR and the Gear VR Controller.
